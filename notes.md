### Get a Globus account

Follow only step 1 of instructions [here](https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/) to get a Globus account.

### Get a Globus ID

Ensure that your `globus ID` is linked with your institutional ID in your globus account:

1. Log into [globus.org](https://www.globus.org/)

2. Click on `Account` on the left hand pane

3. Select the `Identities` tab in the window that opens up

You should see (at least these) two identities:

- One from your home institution (that is listed as primary with a crown)

- Globus ID (<your_username@globusid.org>)

- If you do not see the `Globus ID`, click on `Link another identity`. Select `Globus ID` and link this ID.

### Register at DataFed

1. Once you have a Globus ID, visit the [DataFed web portal](https://datafed.ornl.gov/).

2. Click on the `Log in / Register` button on the top right of the page.

3. Follow the steps to register yourself with DataFed.

4. Though you can log into the DataFed web portal with your institutionâ€™s credentials, you will need the username and password you set up during your registration for scripting.

```{note}
Your institutional credentials are not the same as your DataFed credentials. The latter is only required for using DataFed via python / CLI.
